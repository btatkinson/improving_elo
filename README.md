# Improving Elo

### This is a library for further experimenting with the Elo rating system

#### This repo is a compliment to [my medium post](https://medium.com/@BlakeAtkinson/maximizing-the-elo-rating-system-for-any-sport-part-1-95352bdf6e48).

The only script to run is `main.py`. This will simulate a season.

In order to control the parameters that main.py uses, change the settings in `settings.py`.

To control the Elo calculations, change the formulas in `elo.py`.
