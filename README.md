#Improving Elo

### This is a library for further experimenting with the Elo rating system

#### This post is a compliment to [my medium post](https://medium.com/@BlakeAtkinson/rating-sports-teams-elo-vs-win-loss-d46ee57c1314).

The only script to run is `main.py`. This will simulate a season.

In order to control the parameters that main.py uses, change the settings in `settings.py`.
